RDEPENDS
-------------
-> Within a recipe , run time dependencies can be specified using RDEPEDNS variable.
-> If our recipe says that T depends on P, that means bitbake must deploy P to target system if it deploys T, because T can't be used without P.

Difference between DEPEND and RDEPENDS
----------------------------------------------------------
-> DEPENDS : List of the recipe build-time dependencies
-> RDEPENDS : list of package runtime dependencies. Must be package specific (e.g. with_${PN})
-> RDEPENDS_${PN} ="package_name"

Try
---------

Write a recipe for a C Program which uses lspci system call

Dependency on a specific version
---------------------------------------

Sometimes a recipe have dependencies on specific versions of another recipe.

BitBake allows to reflect this by using:

DEPENDS = "recipe-b (>= 1.2)"
RDEPENDS_${PN} = "recipe-b (>= 1.2)"

The following operators are supported: =, >, <, >= and <=.

Recipe Dependency Information
-------------------------------

Dependency information can help you understand why a recipe is built.

To generate dependency information for a recipe, run the following command:

$ bitbake -g recipename

This command writes the following files in the current directory:

pn-buildlist
==============

	A list of recipes/targets involved in building recipename. 

	 "Involved" here means that at least one task from the recipe needs to run when building recipename from scratch

task-depends.dot
==================

	A graph showing dependencies between tasks.

The graphs are in DOT format and can be converted to images (e.g. using the dot tool from Graphviz).

you can download it using 

$ sudo apt install graphviz

$ man dot
