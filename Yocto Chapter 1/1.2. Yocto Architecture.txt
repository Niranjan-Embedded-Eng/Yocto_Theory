Yocto Project WorkFlow
---------------------------
-> The OpenEmbedded Build System Uses "WorkFlow" to accomplish Images and SDK 
Generation.

-> In General Build WorkFlow Consists of Several Functions

Components of WorkFlow
------------------------------
1) User Configuration: Meta data you can use to control the build process
2) Meta Data Layers: Various Layer that provide software,machine and distro meta data
3) Source Files: Upstream Releases, local projects and SCM's
4) Build System: 
   - Process Under Control of BitBake.
   - This Block Fecthe Source, Apply patch and complete configuration, analyzes the output
      for package generation, creates and test packages, generates imagfes and generates 
      and cross development tools
5) Package Feeds
   - Directories Containing Output Packages (RPM, DEB or IPK).
   - These Packages used for SDK.
   - These later can be sent to Webserver and further work on that.
6) Images : Images produced by workflow
7) Application Development SDK: Cross Development toools that are produced along with Image

Work Flow 
-------------
Step 1: Developers Specify architecture,polices patches and configuration details
Step 2: Build System Fetches and downloads the source code from specfied location
Step 3: Build System Extracts the source in local folder and configurs and compiles the 
          software.
Step 4: Build System then Installs software into temp stack.
Step 5: Different QA and Sanity Checks run throughout Entire build Process.
Step 6: After binaries are created build system generates a binary package feed that is 
          used to create the final root file Image.
Step 7: The Build System Generates the file System Image and ESDK in Parallel.
