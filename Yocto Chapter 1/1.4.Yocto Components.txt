Yocto Components
=============
Let's Understand the following
1. Bitbake Tool
2. Recipes
3. Classes
4. Configurations


1. BITBAKE TOOL
=============
BitBake is a Python Program.
-> It is driven by User Created Configuration, can execute user created tasks for specified 
    target i.e recipes.
-> It is Build engine in Yocto Project. It executes task according to provided recipes,classes
    configuration files and metadata.
-> Bitbake takes recipes(.bb and .bbappend files) as input and does following task
    1. Fetch : Downloads the source file from local or remote.
    2. Unpack: It extracts the source file into source directory.
    3. Patch : Apply Patch on source code.
    4. Configure: Set the flag for the software being build.
    5. Build: Compile source files and generate executable program.
    6. Installation: Executable Program and other file copy to target directory.
    7. Package: Generate the package for target system.

2. RECEIPE
========
-> Receipe are the files which have .bb suffix.
-> It generally contains the information about a particular software.
-> Info regarding where and how to fecth the source, what to patch in the unaltered 
    code, how to configure and complete compilation and finally generate package for 
    that software.

3. CLASSES
========
-> It Contain Information which can be shared between receipes

4. CONFIGURATIONS
================
-> The Configuration Files (.config) define various configuration varibales that govern 
     the build process.
-> They fall into several areas that define machine configuration, compiler tunning options and 
    etc.
