The Yocto Project Layer Model
=====================
- Yocto Project "Layer Model" is a development model for Embedded Linux Development
   that makes Yocto Project Unique from other build System.
- It Supports Collaboration and Customization.
- Layers are repositiories that contains set of Instructions that tell OE Build System what 
  to do.
- We can Always Reuse, Share and Collborate Layers.
- Layers Can Contain Changes to Previous Instructions.
- We Use Layers to logically Sperate Information in our Build.
  Ex: We could Use BSP,GUI, middle ware in diiferent layers.

Why Layered Model ?
===============
- We are tempted to organize our entire Project into one repository.
- But it limits and complicates future Customizations and Reuse.
- Modular Metdata will help to cope change in future.

What is Yocto Layers ?
