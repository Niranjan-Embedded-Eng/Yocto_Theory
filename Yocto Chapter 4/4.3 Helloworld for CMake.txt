Hello World CMake Steps
-----------------------------
Step1: Create a hello world C Program 
Step 2: Create a file CMakeLists.txt in same folder
Step 3: Mkdir build
Step 4: cd build
Step 5: cmake ..
Step 6: ls
Step 7: make
Step 8: or other way cmake --build .

CMakeLists.txt Format
-------------------------
1) CMake Version
--------------------
-> cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
-> check the version when you are in buidl with help of cmake --version
-> This is used to avoid any cryptic error messages due to the CMakeLists.txt assuming a later version of CMake than the one installed on the current host.

2) Project Name
------------------
-> project(cmake_recipe)
-> logically groups a number of targets (libraries, exe and custom build steps ) into a self contained collection taht can be built on its own

3) Set of directives and Instructions
-----------------------------------------
-> add_executable(userprog userprog.c)


What is CmkeLists.txt ?
--------------------------
-> It is input to CMake build system for Building software packaes
-> It contains set of driectives and instructions describing the project source files and targets

Note : Suppose the executable generated now is not set a prescibed target so we need to inform CMake to say were it needs to be installed

Installation
-------------
-> If you want to be able to do a "make install" of your code, you need to specify where targets should end up

-> This is done using the CMake install() function:

-> The syntax for executable is

install (TARGETS Executablename DESTINATION bin)

install (TARGETS userprog DESTINATION bin)

add this line at the end of CMakelist.txt and do make and make install
