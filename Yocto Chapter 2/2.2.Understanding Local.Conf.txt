Understanding Local.conf
----------------------------
-> When we initilize Build Enviornment it creates this .conf file.
-> This File is Very Important as it contains all aspects of build process.
-> We can configure 
      - Target Machine
      - Host architecture related Toolchains etc.
-> The variables inside this file are Important and we can understand the possibilites.
-> We generally change "MACHINE " variable . This variable contains the targe machine for which we are building our Linux Distro.

BSP SUPPORTED BY YOCTO
--------------------------------
- beaglebone-yocto: This is BeagleBone, which is the reference platform for 32-bit ARM
• genericx86: This is generic support for 32-bit x86-based machines
• genericx86-64: This is generic support for 64-bit x86-based machines
• edgerouter: This is EdgeRouter Lite, which is the reference platform for 64-bit MIPS.

-> the machine are available in folder called meta-yocto-bsp.
-> beside this OE Core Provides QEMU for various Machines

DEFAULT CONFIGURATIONS IN LOCAL.CONF FILE
--------------------------------------------------------
1. MACHINE 
	target for which Linux Distro will be Developed.
2. DL_DIR 
	 Download directory for software archives. This directory will contains all the downloaded packages so that it will be used in susequent build.

3. SSTATE_DIR 
	 - This specifes where shared state cache files are stored. it contains pre build binary packages for software components used in build. 
	 - The Purpose of this Directory is to speed up the build process by utilizing already built packages.
	 - When a Package is build for first time the build system stores the binaries, headers and other artifacts in this Directory.

4. TMP_DIR
	-  This is an enviornment variable that to be used for temporary files by various programs and scripts.
            -  This Directory is used as storage of Build artifacts during build provess.
5. DISTRO
           - Variable that specifes the build distribution being built.
           - It is collection of software components + configuration file that work together to build complete linux distribution
           - If we set DISTRO to poky then build system will use configuration files and packages recipes from this ditrbution to build.

6. PACKAGE_CLASSES
	-  Variable that specifies type of packages to be built for Target System.
	-  If we set to package_rpm then Yocto will create RPM Packages.
	- RPM is package management system that is used widely in all package management system [ Red hat , Fedora,CentOS, OpenSUE]
	- DEB package management is widely used on debian and ubuntu systems

7. EXTRA IMAGE FEATURES
	- Variable that specifies the additional features that to be added to target Image.
	- debug-tweaks -- Basically it is an additional feature that can be added to Image. This will add additional tools and utilities that help in debugging and trouble shooting.
	- dbg-pkg -- it adds dbg packages to all the packages which includes symbols for debugging and profiling.
	- dev-pkg -- it add dev packages to all the packages which allows user to develop against the librarie in an Image
	- read-only-rootfs -- it adds RFS with only Read only file system
	- tools-debug -- adds tools such as gdb and strace 
	- tools-sdk -- adds tools such as gcc,make,pkgconfig

8. USER CLASSES
	- The build stats records performance stats about each task executed during the build [ Build time, CPU Usage]
	- The build stats gives us idea like how much time it took to build , so that we can identify the bootle necks. Also additionaly it creates a database of logs.
	- When we use this Class the output goes into BUILDSTATS_BASE directory to ${TMPDIR}/buildstats

9. PATCHRESOLVE
	PATCHRESOLVE=noop
	- Determins the action when pacth fails in build.
	- It can took either one of two values. user or noop
	- noop -- build will simply fail.
	- user -- user means bild it will open a shell by which user can solve the conflicts.

10. BB_DISKMON_DIRS
	- Monitors the Disk Space and inodes available during the build.
	- STOPTASKS,${TMPDIR},1G,100K stops the build after all currently executing tasks complete when the minimum disk space in the ${TMPDIR} directory drops below 1 Gbyte.
	- HALT,${TMPDIR},100M,1K immediately stops the build when the disk space in the ${TMPDIR} directory drops below 100 Mbytes. 

11. CONF_VERSION
	CONF_VERSION = "2"
	- It Specifies the Version of Configuration syntax to be used.
	- It specifies the version of syntax to be used while build for layer.conf and bblayer.conf.
	- Previously 1 was Used and now it is been upgraded to 2 and we can use new features

12. RM_OLD_IMAGE
	RM_OLD_IMAGE = "1"
	- Setting this variable to 1 it will delete all the files which have been built previously. 
13. INHERIT
	INHERIT += "rm_work"
	- Setting this will delete all temporrary files which have been used for built. 
	- This will free up space
