Creation of Yocto Layers
================
-> Layers are used to logically seperate the files in Yocto Project.
-> Layers contain set of Instruction that are used by OE build System.

Steps 
====

S1. Check Exsisting Layer.
-----------------------------
In general, when we want to create layers we need to check weather someone already 
created layer containing the meta data that we need.[ Check Open Embedded Community]

S2. Create a Directory
------------------------
1] cd source 
2] mkdir meta-<layer_Name> 
3] cd meta-<layer_Name>

S3. Create a Layer Configuartion File
----------------------------------------
1] mkdir conf
2] cd conf
3] vi layer.conf
4] Paste the .conf in that file [Copy From meta-yocto-bsp/conf/layer.conf]

S4. Enable your Layer
------------------------
1] cd .. [Be in Your Layer]
2] pwd >> /home/niranjan/Documents/Yocto/build/conf/bblayers.conf 
    Re-directing Path to bblayer.conf

S5. Build Your Layer.
-----------------------
1] Navigate to Yocto Directory
2] Enable Envionrment [source source/poky/oe-init-build-env] 
3] bitbake core-image-minimal

S6. Test the Layers
----------------------
1] bitbake-layers show-layers


UNDERSTANDING LAYER.CONF FILE
========================
Following is an explanantion of layer configuration file:

BBPATH
---------
-> Add's the Layer Root Directory into bitbake Search Path. 
-> bitbake uses this path to locate class,conf and files that have include and require 
      statements.
-> Always Ensure your class and .conf files are unique.

BBFILES
---------
-> Defines the location of all receipes in that layer

BBFILE COLLECTIONS:
-------------------------
-> Establish current layer through Unique Identifier
-> That is used for rest of Build Process

BBFILE PATTERN
-------------------
-> Expands immediately during parsing to provide the directory of layer

BBFILE PRIORITY
--------------------
-> Establish Priority for receipes in the layer when same name receipes found in different layer.

LAYER DEPENDS
-------------------
-> layer dependencies on which this layer is depend.

LAYERSERIES_COMPAT
--------------------------
-> Mention the layer for which the current version thuis layer is compatible.
