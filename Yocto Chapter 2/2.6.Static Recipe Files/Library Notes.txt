What is Library ?
-------------------
-> Library is group of pre-compiled codes,called functions. 
-> To Avoid repetion of code, package is created called Library.
-> Library are not executables. There are used either at Run time or Compile Time.

Types of Libraries
---------------------
- Dynamic 
- Static 

Steps to create Executable File
-----------------------------------
source code ------> Compiler ------> Linker -------> Executable Code
                   .C                   .o  

Linker' task
--------------
- Copying the code of library function into your object code
- Complete code of library function is not copied but made available at run time.

Static Library / Static linking
----------------------------------
- Linker makes a copy of all library functions to executable file.

Steps
-------
- Create Objectable file  [ gcc -c <file_name> -o <obj_name> ]
- Create Archive file using Objetable file [ ar rcs <lib_name.a> <obj1> <obj2> ]
- Create Objectable file for User Program
- Link Object file to Archive file [ gcc -o <obj_name>  <obj_name> .o -L. lib_name.a ]
